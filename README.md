# Detecting-Market-Regimes-with-a-Multi-Feature-Hidden-Markov-Model
# The Model
A Gaussian Hidden Markov Model assumes that observable market data is generated by a latent state process — the "regime" — that transitions between 
 discrete states according to a first-order Markov chain. Each state 
 emits observations from its own multivariate normal distribution 
. The model parameters are estimated via the Baum-Welch algorithm (EM), and the number of states is selected by minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion.
The pipeline has five stages: data collection, feature engineering, PCA, HMM fitting with BIC selection, and diagnostics. Each is explained below with the corresponding code.

#The start
import hmmlearn  which provides the Gaussian HMM implementation with EM training. 
import sklearn  that handles standardization and PCA. 
Financial literature and simmilar repositories suggests markets exhibit 3–8 distinct behavioral modes.
Use BIC as it penalizes unnecessary complexity.
