# Detecting-Market-Regimes-with-a-Multi-Feature-Hidden-Markov-Model
# The Model
A Gaussian Hidden Markov Model assumes that observable market data is generated by a latent state process — the "regime" — that transitions between 
 discrete states according to a first-order Markov chain. Each state 
 emits observations from its own multivariate normal distribution 
. The model parameters are estimated via the Baum-Welch algorithm (EM), and the number of states is selected by minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion.
The pipeline has five stages: data collection, feature engineering, PCA, HMM fitting with BIC selection, and diagnostics. Each is explained below with the corresponding code.
